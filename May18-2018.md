### A year of CodeSandbox - Ives van Hoorne
- Can code live [https://github.com/CompuIves/codesandbox-client]
- Very cool, can try it for interview

### Lightning Talks Session
- [now.sh]
- Deploy to the cloud [https://zeit.co/]
- Gapsby to do druples

### Tests: You're Doing it Wrong! - Le e Byron @leeb
- From Facebook, currently works in Robinhood
- Architure is a Metaphor
- Marcus vitruvius pollo
- Latency, 
- The ability to handle network failure
- Social Calendar App
- Immutatability
- Power versus Principles
- Leverage principled power
- GraphQL: gives you the structure of query
- less trip to the networks, less opportuntuies for failure
- [Thoughts] Instead of querying  orders, line items many requests, make on request and using GraphQL
- Immuatable.js
- Memoization
    - check if the same arguments, return same value out
    - Action
    - (State) => (state)
    - (State) => Promise(<State>)
    - Slow connections:
    - State <- Queue <- Action
    - Grow the action queue, and whne there is network, we make requests and update the true state
    - then return true State in the optimistic state
    - actions, update the queue update the state
    - simplifies app chanlllenges
    - [Thoughts] this architecture we used at Twitter
    - ```
     {
         Server: (State) => Promise<State>
         Optimistic: (State) => State
     }
     ```
- immutable and declarative
- Architecture is about Tradeoffs
    - There always be problems
    - Exploration and Improvement
    - Don't seek for perfection
    - Improve and chanllenge and rebuild
