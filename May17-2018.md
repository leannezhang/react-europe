### 10:30am | The Case for Whimsy - [https://twitter.com/JoshWComeau](Joshua Comeau)
- Sides: https://github.com/joshwcomeau/react-europe-talk-2018/tree/master/src/components
- rendering a ```<canvas>```
- pass the context along
- fastest speaker ever.....
- Email client example
    - UI is a functional of state
    - isOpen: Boolean, open the modal: save in and save out
    - show a demo of saving a draft of an email with animation
    - Meanginful Motin with Action-Driven Animation [http://toblashlin.com/blog]
    - Write self-disabling animation. Whimsy is suppose to be unexpected
- Folding the dom example
    - 3 Dom nodes with the same images
    - Reusing the component
    - Where the viewport is the for buttons are
    - ```<NodeProvider />```: wraps your entire app
    - New context we are creating the Node
    - A way to capture node
    - Pass the state as object
    - ```<NodeConsumer>```
    - Golden rules for changing CSS: Transform and opacity
    - CSS media query ```prefers-reduced-motion```

TODO(liyangz): Read about Context [https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html]
- Context provies a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level
- Look at redux / local state and when to use context

TODO(liyangz): Higher order components

### 11:30am | Subtyping is Overrated - Caleb Meredith
- No Subtyping
- A is a subtype of B
- A is a subtyp of B if any function that safely operates on an instance of B may also safely operate on an instance of A
- Subtyping is a big part of object-oritented programming
- But...subtyping adds overhead
- Subtyping at Runtime
- Dynamically dispatch
- Subtyping is not Abstraction


### 12:00 | Declarative future of gestures and animations in React Native - Krzysztof Magiera @kzzzf

### 2:00pm | On Apollo - Peggy Rayzis @peggyrayzis
- What is Apollo Client?
- Apollo manages updating your *data* just like React manages updating your UI
- 2016: Higher order components are everywhere
    -  release graphQL to declariative fetch UI
    -  first version based on redux
    -  graphql -> all the benefits of connect without writing actions and reducers
    - server-side rendering
- 2018
    - render props
    - New component API with render props
    - backwards compatible
    - It's just a component
    - Async rendering
- [Online editor with React]https://codesandbox.io/
- @apollographql 
- interesting: worth spending sometime looking into it

### 2:30pm | Replicated Redux Jim Purbrick 
- Works at Facebook in London
- Simple shared ReactVR experiences
- view = f(state)
- Redux: nextState = f(state, action)

### Bridging React Native Back to its Roots - Vincent Riemer
- Yoga
- Web Worker
    - App Logic
    - Reconcilliation
- Main Thread
    - Rendering
    - Event Handling
- React Native DOM
    - [github.com/vincentriemer/react-native-dom]

### Do the Right (to Left) Thing - Maja Wichrowska from Airbnb
- Why support right-to-left?
- Arabic display right to left instead of left to right
- Tools:
    - Build-In Gear
    - dir
- airbnb/react-with-direction: context, provider
- `<DirectionProvider />`
- `withDirection()`
- `IconChevronNext`
- airbnb/react-with-styles

### 5:00pm | The fun of runtime type systems (Or: Funtime type systems") - Michel Westrate
- Runtime type systems
- PropTypes
- GraphQL
- Let's build a runtime checker
- All values in the world > All primatives > All numbers > All positive numbers
- `const Type = value => boolean`
- literal types: exactly one failure
-  `const literal = literalValue => value => value == literalValue`
- Union
- `const Union = (...subType) => value => subTypes.some(subType => subType(value))`
- Enumerations
- `const SoldierRole= Enum('solder_A', 'solder_B', 'solder_C')`

### Up and Running with Universal Components - Kurtis Kemple & Samantha Bretous
- What makes a Universal Component?
    - Must be reuseable across platforms
- Well Designed APIs
- Must be available to apps
- Causes bottlenecks
- Creates unneccesary complexity
- Forces design and UX to be limited to things supported on all platforms
